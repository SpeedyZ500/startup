They consider themselves a hero, and the protagonist of all stories, more accurately however is that they are a godlike entity, in that they have godlike power, but they are not omniscient, omnipresent, nor are they omnipotent. They are however very powerful, being able to manipulate classification of them-self and other characters and creatures. They cannot read the contents of this specific entry, and yet they can manipulate the information contained within it. The less savory titles and what is likely a truer description of them is therefore not possible. This page is not to be considered entirely accurate. Some things that are accurate are hidden or altered, some words have been shifted and replaced with similar sounding words, which allows us to track information on them. Look for Patterns, especially for cases of the pattern being broken.",
