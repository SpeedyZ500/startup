Feel free to add biome info as well, and you don't need to fill it all out at the beginning, you will be able to make edits later. You will also be able to add additional information within the world's page, including defining the biomes you make up, and creating/adding wildlife, races, flora, organizations and countries which will automatically be added to the relevant tabs.",
