Best we can tell \"Alastor Moonblaze\" was not his original name, though it is unlikely he remembers his original name, or more likely names, because he is a Remgulus. He is labeled a Side Character because he feels so strongly that he isn't anyone important, he is just some guy hanging out. \n He is someone who does his best to be a good person, and feels he often falls short."
