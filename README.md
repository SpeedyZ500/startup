# Project Yggdrasil

[My Notes](notes.md)

A shared Authoring Site where you can submitt writing prompts and build off of other people's stories. What makes it special is that you are able to create branching timelines at the chapter level, meaning if you want to continue the story, you can, if you feel like a chapter could have gone another way, and the characters could have taken a different path, go ahead and write it, make a new branch of the timeline who knows maybe the story overseer (the other of the original story part) will decide that your timeline is actuatually the main timeline. The goal is to create a site that allows for expansive multiverses, where creators can feel free to try out many different possibilites, and **colaborate** as they improve their worldbuilding, writing, and charactor development skills in an environment where they can get feedback and see examples of other people's work on the same story.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

>  If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [ ] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [ ] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever had an idea for a story, but not known how to write it, or a part of a story but you don't know how to start it, or a start of a story that you don't know how to continue? Have you ever been reading/listening to/watching a story/movie/tv show and asked yourself what if **X** happened instead or **X** was there? Project Yggdrasil makes all this and more possible to work with just start by sharing what you have, the Norse Myth of Yggdrasil the World Tree is that of a tree that connects the Nine Relms, but the tree of Project Yggdrasil is the endless branching timelines, users are able to use it to read and create endlessly branching stories, provide each other feedback on their storytelling, and share writing tips. If a user is reading an otherwise compelling story, they can go to the chapter where things started going in the wrong direction and create their own branch of the story, their own timeline that others can build off of.

### Design

![Mock](Project_Yggdrisil_HomePage.png)

Here is a sequence diagram that shows how people would interact with the backend to submit a writing prompt, write a story or story part for it, and then continue or split off of the orignial branches to move in a different direction.
