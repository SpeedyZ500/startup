            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                Welcome to Project Yggdrasil.
                <br />
                <br />
                Project Yggdrasil is a group authoring site where you can make branching timelines of the stories you like, 
                and continue the storyline. If you ever feel a story is going in the wrong direction, 
                you can just make a branch at the chapter that it started going off track at. Do your best to stay lore accurate to the stories,
                the best way to check for lore is to go to the World Building Tab, where you can find information on Magic systems, races
                wildlife (monsters, magical creatures, etc.), cities, and countries (and their relevant stories).
                <br />
                <br />
                Please be respectful and refrain from hate speach in the coments. I'm not sure about the stories, please be respectful,
                however there is something to be said about those atributes being useful when making villans. 
                Please tag your stories with the apropriate content warnings and genre(s). 
                <br />
                <br />
                I have tried to ensure that AI won't be able to scrape this site, but I don't know if they will scrape it anyways.
                <br />
                <br />
                <h5>Mysterious Content Warnings</h5>
                <br />
                You may encounter a content warning tag labeled "Fallen Universe," or "Lost Branch," these tags refer to
                events on a scale that lead to multiversal collaps. "Lost Branches," are only on the scale of the timeline.
                "Fallen Universes" are lost enterly from the trunck of the World Tree, to the void, and as far as The Curator
                can tell, are lost forever.
                <br />
                <br />
                <h5>Who is The Curator?</h5>
                <br />
                That is an exellent question, sadly we at Project Yggdrasil can't realy answer that. The Curator could be Spencer, the creator of this site,
                however he has implied that it is not him, and that this site, is "just an access point into a location within the void, between realities."
                This location is known as a World Tree, yes this site allows people to write and share stories, these stories however come from tapping into 
                the energy of imagination, which the World Tree is made of, and the Worlds it connects are imagination given form. That realy doesn't answer
                the question of who "The Curator" is, all the known information on this elusive entity can be found in the Characters tab.
