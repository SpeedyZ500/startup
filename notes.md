## GitHub Notes
I have learned how to use Markdown this is something I should have learned a while ago but with it you can:
1. Create lists 
   - including nested lists like this one
2. create a task list
   - [x] create a checkbox that I won't fill
   - [ ] goof off in class
3. *Use* all kinds of ~~terrible~~ **Wonderful** formatting options


## AWS Notes

I learned that you need to actually put your server into the domain in to be able to use it
I learned how to create a new site
I also learned what Sudo does it makes you the super user

## HTML Notes

Learned you need to use href = "" to insert hyperlinks
need to specify width and height
make sure you are copying the image address not a link to the image location
use width and height to specify image size or you can use fit and you don't nessisaraly need to specify height
I also learned how all the inputs work, will be very useful for my site
Use <search> var type for search bar
Multiple ways to embed audio
Must have warn when connecting to http: to go live for whatever reason
Should be able to store the html in a sub-folder hopefully
