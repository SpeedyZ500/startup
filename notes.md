## GitHub Notes
I have learned how to use Markdown this is something I should have learned a while ago but with it you can:
1. Create lists 
   - including nested lists like this one
2. create a task list
   - [x] create a checkbox that I won't fill
   - [ ] goof off in class
3. *Use* all kinds of ~~terrible~~ **Wonderful** formatting options


## AWS Notes

I learned that you need to actually put your server into the domain in to be able to use it
I learned how to create a new site
I also learned what Sudo does it makes you the super user

## HTML Notes

Learned you need to use href = "" to insert hyperlinks
need to specify width and height
make sure you are copying the image address not a link to the image location
use width and height to specify image size or you can use fit and you don't nessisarily need to specify height
I also learned how all the inputs work, will be very useful for my site
Use <search> var type for search bar
Multiple ways to embed audio
Must have warn when connecting to http: to go live for whatever reason
Should be able to store the html in a sub-folder hopefully

## CSS Notes
@media queries is for max sizes and flex and stuff and you can make it so that you can do light and dark mode, as well as enabling moving nav into a Hamburger if it request a screen size to small to display

bootstrap stuff 
https://cdn.jsdeliver.net/npm/boot-strap

``` html
<body> 
  ...

  <script
    src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"
    integrity="sha384-kenU1KFdBIe4zVF0s0G1M5b4hcpxyD9F7jL+jjXkk+Q2h455rYXK/7HAuoJl+0I4"
    crossorigin="anonymous"
  ></script>
</body>
```

is what you use for the bootstrap Java Script Elements

Bootstrap documentation: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/

Cards are something you can do

## JavaScript/React Notes
props are what you use for the components declared in the function portion of the JavaScript
jsx is a language,

You can do anything with React and Vite and stuff
full power of html and CSS and Java Script
Setting states styles and stuff
I suspect that this will be very useful for my thing, setting the states of names and other stuff to the values of description names and stuff
as well as a list value
and states of what links to link to within the code
This is how I am going to be able to have a wiki like database for characters, magic systems and stuff
only pretends to change pages, states stay
runs like an application on your desktop
Routers are cool
React is a library
dom router
react-router-dom
use CSS as normal
npm  run dev to launch the react
Need to port everything to react
Pretty much mostly dealating 
Wish I only did a couple of example files
You can fetch json data!!! I will create .jsx files that put data from .JSON files and pull the requisite info into the files!
Each page may need to have a function that gets the list or the .json file, so that other files/folders/whatever can pass in an id, and then get the list, or the .json file and pull data from it

## Service
Must send cookies Securely; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict
HttpOnly means no js


## Testing
Jest, testing program, 
Testing helps us test regression
Write Better Code
Think like a user
